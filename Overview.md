# Overview

Passport is authentication middleware for [Node](http://nodejs.org/). It is designed to serve a singular purpose: authenticate requests. When writing modules, encapsulation is a virtue, so Passport delegates all other functionality to the application. This separation of concerns keeps code clean and maintainable, and makes Passport extremely easy to integrate into an application.

In modern web applications, authentication can take a variety of forms. Traditionally, users log in by providing a username and password. With the rise of social networking, single sign-on using an [OAuth](http://oauth.net/) provider such as [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) has become a popular authentication method. Services that expose an API often require token-based credentials to protect access.

Passport recognizes that each application has unique authentication requirements. Authentication mechanisms, known as *strategies*, are packaged as individual modules. Applications can choose which strategies to employ, without creating unnecessary dependencies.

Despite the complexities involved in authentication, code does not have to be complicated.

```javascript
app.post('/login', passport.authenticate('local', { successRedirect: '/',
                                                    failureRedirect: '/login' }));
```

## Install

```shell
$ npm install passport
```
