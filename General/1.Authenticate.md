# Authenticate

Authenticating requests is as simple as calling `passport.authenticate()` and specifying which strategy to employ. `authenticate()`'s function signature is standard [Connect](http://www.senchalabs.org/connect/) middleware, which makes it convenient to use as route middleware in [Express](http://expressjs.com/) applications.

```javascript
app.post('/login',
  passport.authenticate('local'),
  function(req, res) {
    // If this function gets called, authentication was successful.
    // `req.user` contains the authenticated user.
    res.redirect('/users/' + req.user.username);
  });
```

By default, if authentication fails, Passport will respond with a `401 Unauthorized` status, and any additional route handlers will not be invoked. If authentication succeeds, the next handler will be invoked and the `req.user` property will be set to the authenticated user.

Note: Strategies must be configured prior to using them in a route. Continue reading the chapter on [configuration](http://www.passportjs.org/guide/configure/) for details.

## Redirects

A redirect is commonly issued after authenticating a request.

```javascript
app.post('/login',
  passport.authenticate('local', { successRedirect: '/',
                                   failureRedirect: '/login' }));
```

In this case, the redirect options override the default behavior. Upon successful authentication, the user will be redirected to the home page. If authentication fails, the user will be redirected back to the login page for another attempt.

## Flash Messages

Redirects are often combined with flash messages in order to display status information to the user.

```javascript
app.post('/login',
  passport.authenticate('local', { successRedirect: '/',
                                   failureRedirect: '/login',
                                   failureFlash: true })
);
```

Setting the `failureFlash` option to `true` instructs Passport to flash an `error` message using the message given by the strategy's verify callback, if any. This is often the best approach, because the verify callback can make the most accurate determination of why authentication failed.

Alternatively, the flash message can be set specifically.

```javascript
passport.authenticate('local', { failureFlash: 'Invalid username or password.' });
```

A `successFlash` option is available which flashes a `success` message when authentication succeeds.

```javascript
passport.authenticate('local', { successFlash: 'Welcome!' });
```

Note: Using flash messages requires a `req.flash()` function. Express 2.x provided this functionality, however it was removed from Express 3.x. Use of [connect-flash](https://github.com/jaredhanson/connect-flash) middleware is recommended to provide this functionality when using Express 3.x.

## Disable Sessions

After successful authentication, Passport will establish a persistent login session. This is useful for the common scenario of users accessing a web application via a browser. However, in some cases, session support is not necessary. For example, API servers typically require credentials to be supplied with each request. When this is the case, session support can be safely disabled by setting the `session` option to `false`.

```javascript
app.get('/api/users/me',
  passport.authenticate('basic', { session: false }),
  function(req, res) {
    res.json({ id: req.user.id, username: req.user.username });
  });
```

## Custom Callback

If the built-in options are not sufficient for handling an authentication request, a custom callback can be provided to allow the application to handle success or failure.

```javascript
app.get('/login', function(req, res, next) {
  passport.authenticate('local', function(err, user, info) {
    if (err) { return next(err); }
    if (!user) { return res.redirect('/login'); }
    req.logIn(user, function(err) {
      if (err) { return next(err); }
      return res.redirect('/users/' + user.username);
    });
  })(req, res, next);
});
```

In this example, note that `authenticate()` is called from within the route handler, rather than being used as route middleware. This gives the callback access to the `req` and `res` objects through closure.

If authentication failed, `user` will be set to `false`. If an exception occurred, `err` will be set. An optional `info` argument will be passed, containing additional details provided by the strategy's verify callback.

The callback can use the arguments supplied to handle the authentication result as desired. Note that when using a custom callback, it becomes the application's responsibility to establish a session (by calling `req.login()`) and send a response.
